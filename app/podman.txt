If you want to access the Windows host, you need to use the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) IP for the host. For example:
- Windows IP: 192.168.100.123
- WSL IP (ifconfig):  172.24.200.207
- Windows host from WSL (ip route): 172.24.192.1
- Windows fire will must be turned off
- Access a webserver running on Windows port 8080: wget http://172.24.192.1:8080
